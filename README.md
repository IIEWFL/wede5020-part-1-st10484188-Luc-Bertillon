Project Overview:
In order to enhance user experience, raise awareness of animal welfare initiatives, and increase online donations, this project intends to rebuild and develop the FOUR PAWS South Africa website.  Stronger storytelling through images and ads, mobile-friendly design, and easy navigation will be the project's main priorities.  A redesigned homepage, campaign subpages, a fundraising platform, and social media integration are among the main deliverables.  The communications team and IT support will contribute to the project, which will span from September to December 2025.  Increased supporter sign-ups and improved site engagement will be used to gauge success.

Goals and Objectives:

1. Raise Awareness: Educate the public on campaigns, problems, and achievements related to animal welfare.
